# Templating Buddy
You know when you have to add calendar items for work/school. You have to enter a lot of information so that everyone has all the details, which takes way too much time and effort.

As a solution, we have: Templating Buddy. This AI helps you with repetitive, boring, but important tasks.

In an organization with volunteers, the workload relies entirely on people's free time and requires a lot of individual initiative. To make this as smooth as possible, everyone should be able to accomplish a lot with minimal effort.

When entering the data, real-time predictions are made in the empty fields. Additionally, the color of the item changes based on its label.
